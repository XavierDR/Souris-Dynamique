    gettextPython-httplib2/%s (gzip)Jonathan FeinbergAuthentication.responseAuthentication.__bool__Determine freshness from the Date, Expires and Cache-Control headers.

    We don't handle the following:

    1. Cache-Control: max-stale
    2. Age: headers are not used in the calculations.

    Not that this algorithm is simpler than you might think
    because we are operating as a private (non-shared) cache.
    This lets us ignore 's-maxage'. We can also ignore
    'proxy-invalidate' since we aren't a proxy.
    We will never return a stale document as
    fresh as a design decision, and thus the non-implementation
    of 'max-stale'. This also lets us safely ignore 'must-revalidate'
    since we operate as if every server has sent 'must-revalidate'.
    Since we are private we get to ignore both 'public' and
    'private' parameters. We also ignore 'no-transform' since
    we don't do any transformations.
    The 'no-store' parameter is handled at a higher level.
    So the only Cache-Control parameters we look at are:

    no-cache
    only-if-cached
    max-age
    min-fresh

          proxy_type: The type of proxy server.  This must be set to one of
          socks.PROXY_TYPE_XXX constants.  For example:

            p = ProxyInfo(proxy_type=socks.PROXY_TYPE_HTTP,
              proxy_host='localhost', proxy_port=8000)

          proxy_host: The hostname or IP address of the proxy server.

          proxy_port: The port that the proxy server is running on.

          proxy_rdns: If True (default), DNS queries will not be performed
          locally, and instead, handed to the proxy to resolve.  This is useful
          if the network does not allow resolution of non-local names.  In
          httplib2 0.9 and earlier, this defaulted to False.

          proxy_user: The username used to authenticate with the proxy server.

          proxy_pass: The password used to authenticate with the proxy server.

        any time a request requires authentication.GoogleLogin Auth=has_timeoutif-none-matchFileCache.deleteFileCache.getproxy-authenticateAuthentication.__ge__%s:email.feedparser Performs a single HTTP request.
The 'uri' is the URI of the HTTP resource and can begin
with either 'http' or 'https'. The value of 'uri' must be an absolute URI.

The 'method' is the HTTP method to perform, such as GET, POST, DELETE, etc.
There is no restriction on the methods allowed.

The 'body' is the entity body to be sent with the request. It is a string
object.

Any extra headers that are to be sent with the request should be provided in the
'headers' dictionary.

The maximum number of redirect to follow before raising an
exception is 'redirections. The default is 5.

The return value is a tuple of (response, content), the first
being and instance of the 'Response' class, the second being
a string that contains the response entity body.

        `proxy_info` may be:
          - a callable that takes the http scheme ('http' or 'https') and
            returns a ProxyInfo instance per request. By default, uses
            proxy_info_from_environment.
          - a ProxyInfo instance (static proxy config).
          - None (proxy disabled).

        ca_certs is the path of a file containing root CA certificates for SSL
        server certificate validation.  By default, a CA cert file bundled with
        httplib2 is used.

        If disable_ssl_certificate_validation is true, SSL cert validation will
        not be performed.

    Args:
        value: The string/bytes value to be converted.
        encoding: The encoding to use to convert unicode to bytes. Defaults
                  to "ascii", which will not allow any characters from ordinals

                  which will only allows byte ordinals (up to 255) and "utf-8",
                  which will encode any unicode that needs to be.

        .googleapiclientexpires_inOAuth2Credentials._generate_refresh_request_headersGoogleCredentials._implicit_credentials_from_filesAuthorize an httplib2.Http instance with these credentials.

        The modified http.request method will add authentication headers to
        each request and will refresh access_tokens when a 401 is received on a
        request. In addition the http.request method has a credentials
        property, http.request.credentials, which is the Credentials object
        that authorized it.

        Args:
            http: An instance of ``httplib2.Http`` or something that acts
                  like it.

        Returns:
            A modified instance of http that was passed in.

        Example::

            h = httplib2.Http()
            h = credentials.authorize(h)

        You can't create a new OAuth subclass of httplib2.Authentication
        because it never gets passed the absolute URI, which is needed for
        signing. So instead we have to overload 'request' with a closure
        that adds in the Authorization header and then calls the original
        version of 'request()'.

        OOB_CALLBACK_URNCredentials object for OAuth 2.0.

    Credentials can be applied to an httplib2.Http object using the
    authorize() method, which then signs each request from that object
    with the OAuth 2.0 access token. This set of credentials is for the
    use case where you have acquired an OAuth 2.0 access_token from
    another place such as a JavaScript client or another web
    application, and wish to use it from Python. Because only the
    access_token is present it can not be refreshed and will in time
    expire.

    AccessTokenCredentials objects may be safely pickled and unpickled.

    Usage::

        credentials = AccessTokenCredentials('<an access token>',
            'my-user-agent/1.0')
        http = httplib2.Http()
        http = credentials.authorize(http)

    Typical cache storage would be App Engine memcache service,
    but you can pass in any other cache client that implements
    these methods:

    * ``get(key, namespace=ns)``
    * ``set(key, value, namespace=ns)``

    Usage::

        # without caching
        client_type, client_info = loadfile('secrets.json')
        # using App Engine memcache service
        from google.appengine.api import memcache

        Credentials object for Compute Engine Assertion Grants

    This object will allow a Compute Engine instance to identify itself to
    Google and other OAuth 2.0 servers that can verify assertions. It can be
    used for the purpose of accessing data stored under an account assigned to
    the Compute Engine instance itself.

    This credential does not require a flow to instantiate because it
    represents a two legged flow, and therefore has all of the required
    information to generate and refresh its own access tokens.

    rafek@google.com (Rafe Kaplan)A decorator to declare that only the first N arguments my be positional.

    This decorator makes it easy to support Python 3 style keyword-only
    parameters. For example, in Python 3 it is possible to write::

        def fn(pos1, *, kwonly1=None, kwonly1=None):
            ...

    All named parameters after ``*`` must be a keyword::

        fn(10, 'kw1', 'kw2')  # Raises exception.
        fn(10, kwonly1='kw1')  # Ok.

    Example
    ^^^^^^^

    To define a function like above, do::

        @positional(1)
        def fn(pos1, kwonly1=None, kwonly2=None):
            ...

    If no default value is provided to a keyword argument, it becomes a
    required keyword argument::

        @positional(0)
        def fn(required_kw):
            ...

    This must be called with the keyword parameter::

        fn()  # Raises exception.
        fn(10)  # Raises exception.
        fn(required_kw=10)  # Ok.

    When defining instance or class methods always remember to account for
    ``self`` and ``cls``::

        class MyClass(object):

            @positional(2)
            def my_method(self, pos1, kwonly1=None):
                ...

            @classmethod
            @positional(2)
            def my_method(cls, pos1, kwonly1=None):
                ...

    The positional decorator behavior is controlled by
    ``util.positional_parameters_enforcement``, which may be set to
    ``POSITIONAL_EXCEPTION``, ``POSITIONAL_WARNING`` or
    ``POSITIONAL_IGNORE`` to raise an exception, log a warning, or do
    nothing, respectively, if a declaration is violated.

    Args:
        max_positional_arguments: Maximum number of positional arguments. All
                                  parameters after the this index must be
                                  keyword only.

    Returns:
        A decorator that prevents using arguments after max_positional_args
        from being used as positional parameters.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if a key-word only argument is provided as a positional
                   parameter, but only if
                   util.positional_parameters_enforcement is set to
                   POSITIONAL_EXCEPTION.

Requests HTTP library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests is an HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings. Basic GET
usage:

   >>> import requests
   >>> r = requests.get('https://www.python.org')
   >>> r.status_code
   200
   >>> 'Python is a programming language' in r.content
   True

... or POST:

   >>> payload = dict(key1='value1', key2='value2')
   >>> r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
   >>> print(r.text)
   {
     ...
     "form": {
       "key2": "value2",
       "key1": "value1"
     },
     ...
   }

The other HTTP methods are supported - see `requests.api`. Full documentation
is at <http://python-requests.org>.

__build__init_poolmanagerskip_accept_encodingHTTPAdapter.sendproxy_managerHTTPAdapter.proxy_manager_forInitializes a urllib3 PoolManager.

        This method should not be called from user code, and is only
        exposed for use when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
        :param maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
        :param block: Block when no free connections are available.
        :param pool_kwargs: Extra keyword arguments used to initialize the Pool Manager.
        build_responseproxy_kwargsputheaderReturns a urllib3 connection for the given URL. This should not be

        Currently, this just closes the PoolManager, which closes pooled
        connections.
        _pool_block
requests.adapters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module contains the transport adapters that Requests uses to define
and maintain connections.
packages.urllib3.response0

request_urlObtain the url to use when making the final request.

        If the message is being sent through a HTTP proxy, the full URL has to
        be used. Otherwise, we should only use the path portion of the URL.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` being sent.
        :param proxies: A dictionary of schemes or schemes and hosts to proxy URLs.
        Add any headers needed by the connection. As of v2.0 this does
        nothing by default, but is left for overriding by users that subclass
        the :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` to add headers to.
        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments from the call to send().
        HTTPAdapter.cert_verifypackages.urllib3.poolmanagerHTTPAdapter.init_poolmanagerpackages.urllib3.util.retryBaseAdapter.sendputrequestHTTPAdapter.__getstate__The Base Transport AdapterHTTPAdapter.__init__BaseAdapter.closeendheadersBuilds a :class:`Response <requests.Response>` object from a urllib3
        response. This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed
        for use when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`

        :param req: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` used to generate the response.
        :param resp: The urllib3 response object.
        HTTPAdapter.closeHTTPAdapter.__setstate__Returns a dictionary of the headers to add to any request sent
        through a proxy. This works with urllib3 magic to ensure that they are
        correctly sent to the proxy, rather than in a tunnelled request if
        CONNECT is being used.

        This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use
        when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param proxies: The url of the proxy being used for this request.

Pass a (connect, read) timeout tuple, or a single float to set both timeouts to the same valueSends PreparedRequest object. Returns Response object.

        :param request: The :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` being sent.
        :param stream: (optional) Whether to stream the request content.
        :param timeout: (optional) How long to wait for the server to send
            data before giving up, as a float, or a :ref:`(connect timeout,
            read timeout) <timeouts>` tuple.
        :type timeout: float or tuple
        :param verify: (optional) Whether to verify SSL certificates.
        :param cert: (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate to be trusted.
        :param proxies: (optional) The proxies dictionary to apply to the request.
        HTTPAdapter.request_urlHTTPAdapter.proxy_headersVerify a SSL certificate. This method should not be called from user
        code, and is only exposed for use when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param conn: The urllib3 connection object associated with the cert.
        :param url: The requested URL.
        :param verify: Whether we should actually verify the certificate.
        :param cert: The SSL certificate to verify.
        The built-in HTTP Adapter for urllib3.

    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and
    HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter interface. This class will
    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param int max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
        connections. If you need granular control over the conditions under
        which we retry a request, import urllib3's ``Retry`` class and pass
        that instead.
    :param pool_block: Whether the connection pool should block for connections.

    Usage::

      >>> import requests
      >>> s = requests.Session()
      >>> a = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=3)
      >>> s.mount('http://', a)
    proxy_poolReturn urllib3 ProxyManager for the given proxy.

        This method should not be called from user code, and is only
        exposed for use when subclassing the
        :class:`HTTPAdapter <requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter>`.

        :param proxy: The proxy to return a urllib3 ProxyManager for.
        :param proxy_kwargs: Extra keyword arguments used to configure the Proxy Manager.
        :returns: ProxyManager
        Constructs and sends a :class:`Request <Request>`.

    :param method: method for the new :class:`Request` object.
    :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.
    :param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query string for the :class:`Request`.

    The code in `cookielib.CookieJar` expects this interface in order to correctly
    manage cookie policies, i.e., determine whether a cookie can be set, given the
    domains of the request and the cookie.

    The original request object is read-only. The client is responsible for collecting
    the new headers via `get_new_headers()` and interpreting them appropriately. You
    probably want `get_cookie_header`, defined below.

    Use .get and .set and include domain and path args in order to be more specific.Compatibility class; is a cookielib.CookieJar, but exposes a dict
    interface.

    This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and sessions that
    don't specify one, since some clients may expect response.cookies and
    session.cookies to support dict operations.

    Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it's just for
    compatibility with external client code. All requests code should work
    out of the box with externally provided instances of ``CookieJar``, e.g.
    ``LWPCookieJar`` and ``FileCookieJar``.

    Unlike a regular CookieJar, this class is pickleable.

        read into memory.  This is not necessarily the length of each item
        returned as decoding can take place.

        If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the best
        available encoding based on the response.

        This function eventually generates a ``Cookie`` header from the
        given cookies using cookielib. Due to cookielib's design, the header
        will not be regenerated if it already exists, meaning this function
        can only be called once for the life of the
        :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>` object. Any subsequent calls
        to ``prepare_cookies`` will have no actual effect, unless the "Cookie"
        header is removed beforehand.Build the path URL to use.Prepares the given HTTP auth data.Response.__nonzero__A user-created :class:`Request <Request>` object.

    Used to prepare a :class:`PreparedRequest <PreparedRequest>`, which is sent to the server.

    :param method: HTTP method to use.
    :param url: URL to send.
    :param headers: dictionary of headers to send.
    :param files: dictionary of {filename: fileobject} files to multipart upload.
    :param data: the body to attach to the request. If a dictionary is provided, form-encoding will take place.
    :param json: json for the body to attach to the request (if files or data is not specified).
    :param params: dictionary of URL parameters to append to the URL.
    :param auth: Auth handler or (user, pass) tuple.
    :param cookies: dictionary or CookieJar of cookies to attach to this request.

    PreparedRequest.prepare_hooksPrepares the given HTTP body data.PreparedRequest.prepare_authTrue if this Response one of the permanent versions of redirectURL has an invalid label.Content of the response, in unicode.

        If Response.encoding is None, encoding will be guessed using
        ``chardet``.

        The encoding of the response content is determined based solely on HTTP
        headers, following RFC 2616 to the letter. If you can take advantage of
        non-HTTP knowledge to make a better guess at the encoding, you should
        set ``r.encoding`` appropriately before accessing this property.
        Returns the json-encoded content of a response, if any.

        :param \*\*kwargs: Optional arguments that ``json.loads`` takes.

Debian and other distributions "unbundle" requests' vendored dependencies, and
rewrite all imports to use the global versions of ``urllib3`` and ``chardet``.
The problem with this is that not only requests itself imports those
dependencies, but third-party code outside of the distros' control too.

In reaction to these problems, the distro maintainers replaced
``requests.packages`` with a magical "stub module" that imports the correct
modules. The implementations were varying in quality and all had severe
problems. For example, a symlink (or hardlink) that links the correct modules
into place introduces problems regarding object identity, since you now have
two modules in `sys.modules` with the same API, but different identities::

    requests.packages.urllib3 is not urllib3

With version ``2.5.2``, requests started to maintain its own stub, so that
distro-specific breakage would be reduced to a minimum, even though the whole
issue is not requests' fault in the first place. See
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/2375 for the corresponding pull
request.

    :param headers:
        An iterable of field-value pairs. Must not contain multiple field names
        when compared case-insensitively.

    :param kwargs:
        Additional field-value pairs to pass in to ``dict.update``.

    A ``dict`` like container for storing HTTP Headers.

    Field names are stored and compared case-insensitively in compliance with
    RFC 7230. Iteration provides the first case-sensitive key seen for each
    case-insensitive pair.

    Using ``__setitem__`` syntax overwrites fields that compare equal
    case-insensitively in order to maintain ``dict``'s api. For fields that
    compare equal, instead create a new ``HTTPHeaderDict`` and use ``.add``
    in a loop.

    If multiple fields that are equal case-insensitively are passed to the
    constructor or ``.update``, the behavior is undefined and some will be
    lost.

    Based on httplib.HTTPConnection but provides an extra constructor
    backwards-compatibility layer between older and newer Pythons.

    Additional keyword parameters are used to configure attributes of the connection.
    Accepted parameters include:

      - ``strict``: See the documentation on :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool`
      - ``source_address``: Set the source address for the current connection.

        .. note:: This is ignored for Python 2.6. It is only applied for 2.7 and 3.x

      - ``socket_options``: Set specific options on the underlying socket. If not specified, then
        defaults are loaded from ``HTTPConnection.default_socket_options`` which includes disabling
        Nagle's algorithm (sets TCP_NODELAY to 1) unless the connection is behind a proxy.

        For example, if you wish to enable TCP Keep Alive in addition to the defaults,
        you might pass::

            HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
                (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),
            ]

        Or you may want to disable the defaults by passing an empty list (e.g., ``[]``).

        Get a connection. Will return a pooled connection if one is available.

        If no connections are available and :prop:`.block` is ``False``, then a
        fresh connection is returned.

        :param timeout:
            Seconds to wait before giving up and raising
            :class:`urllib3.exceptions.EmptyPoolError` if the pool is empty and

        _make_requestHTTPConnectionPool._validate_conn
    Same as :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool`, but HTTPS.

    When Python is compiled with the :mod:`ssl` module, then
    :class:`.VerifiedHTTPSConnection` is used, which *can* verify certificates,
    instead of :class:`.HTTPSConnection`.

    :class:`.VerifiedHTTPSConnection` uses one of ``assert_fingerprint``,
    ``assert_hostname`` and ``host`` in this order to verify connections.
    If ``assert_hostname`` is False, no verification is done.

    The ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, ``cert_reqs``, ``ca_certs``,
    ``ca_cert_dir``, and ``ssl_version`` are only used if :mod:`ssl` is
    available and are fed into :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket` to upgrade
    the connection socket into an SSL socket.

            Connection object for the current host and port as returned by
            :meth:`._new_conn` or :meth:`._get_conn`.

        If the pool is already full, the connection is closed and discarded
        because we exceeded maxsize. If connections are discarded frequently,
        then maxsize should be increased.

        If the pool is closed, then the connection will be closed and discarded.
        
        Establish tunnel connection early, because otherwise httplib

        Perform a request on a given urllib connection object taken from our
        pool.

        :param conn:
            a connection from one of our connection pools

        :param timeout:
            Socket timeout in seconds for the request. This can be a
            float or integer, which will set the same timeout value for
            the socket connect and the socket read, or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`, which gives you more fine-grained
            control over your timeouts.
        Pool reached maximum size and no more connections are allowed.
    Given a url, return an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance of its host.

    This is a shortcut for not having to parse out the scheme, host, and port
    of the url before creating an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance.

    :param url:
        Absolute URL string that must include the scheme. Port is optional.

    :param \**kw:
        Passes additional parameters to the constructor of the appropriate
        :class:`.ConnectionPool`. Useful for specifying things like
        timeout, maxsize, headers, etc.

    Example::

        >>> conn = connection_from_url('http://google.com/')
        >>> r = conn.request('GET', '/')
    Failed to parse headers (url=%s): %sResetting dropped connection: %sCannot connect to proxy.HTTPConnectionPool._put_connConnection aborted.HTTPSConnectionPool._new_connhttplib_request_kwHTTP/?EAGAINHTTPConnectionPool._get_conn
    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

    :param strict:
        Causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can't be parsed
        as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line, passed into
        :class:`httplib.HTTPConnection`.

        .. note::
           Only works in Python 2. This parameter is ignored in Python 3.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ProxyManager`"

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.

        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method provided
           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body (useful for creating
            POST requests, see HTTPConnectionPool.post_url for
            more convenience).

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When False, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param \**response_kw:
            Additional parameters are passed to
            :meth:`urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.from_httplib`
        HTTPConnectionPool._make_requestIs the error actually a timeout? Will raise a ReadTimeout or pass_http_vsn_strStarting new HTTPS connection (%d): %s

        Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised.

    collector of pypy.

Follow these instructions if you would
like to verify SSL certificates in Python 2. Note, the default libraries do
*not* do certificate checking; you need to do additional work to validate
certificates yourself.

This needs the following packages installed:

* pyOpenSSL (tested with 0.13)
* ndg-httpsclient (tested with 0.3.2)
* pyasn1 (tested with 0.1.6)

You can install them with the following command:

    pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1

To activate certificate checking, call
:func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3` from your Python code
before you begin making HTTP requests. This can be done in a ``sitecustomize``
module, or at any other time before your application begins using ``urllib3``,
like this::

    try:
        import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
        urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
    except ImportError:
        pass

Now you can use :mod:`urllib3` as you normally would, and it will support SNI
when the required modules are installed.

Activating this module also has the positive side effect of disabling SSL/TLS
compression in Python 2 (see `CRIME attack`_).

If you want to configure the default list of supported cipher suites, you can
set the ``urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.DEFAULT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`` variable.

        Helper function to format and quote a single header.

        Useful for single headers that are composed of multiple items. E.g.,
        'Content-Disposition' fields.

        :param header_parts:
            A sequence of (k, v) typles or a :class:`dict` of (k, v) to format

            The name of the parameter, a string expected to be ASCII only.
        :param value:
            The value of the parameter, provided as a unicode string.
        Content-LocationRequestField.render_headers"\

    A data container for request body parameters.

    :param name:
        The name of this request field.
    :param data:
        The data/value body.
    :param filename:
        An optional filename of the request field.
    :param headers:
        An optional dict-like object of headers to initially use for the field.
    RequestField._render_part
        A :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField` factory from old-style tuple parameters.

        Supports constructing :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField` from
        parameter of key/value strings AND key/filetuple. A filetuple is a
        (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where the MIME type is optional.
        For example::

            'foo': 'bar',
            'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
            'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),
            'typedfile': ('bazfile.bin', open('bazfile').read(), 'image/jpeg'),
            'nonamefile': 'contents of nonamefile field',

        Field names and filenames must be unicode.
        RequestField._render_parts%s="%s"
        Renders the headers for this request field.
        guess_typeapplication/octet-stream%s*=%sRequestField.make_multipart
        Makes this request field into a multipart request field.

        This method overrides "Content-Disposition", "Content-Type" and
        "Content-Location" headers to the request parameter.

        :param content_type:
            The 'Content-Type' of the request body.
        :param content_location:
            The 'Content-Location' of the request body.

        
    Guess the "Content-Type" of a file.

    :param filename:
        The filename to guess the "Content-Type" of using :mod:`mimetypes`.
    :param default:
        If no "Content-Type" can be guessed, default to `default`.
    
    Helper function to format and quote a single header parameter.

    Particularly useful for header parameters which might contain
    non-ASCII values, like file names. This follows RFC 2231, as
    suggested by RFC 2388 Section 4.4.

    :param name:
        The name of the parameter, a string expected to be ASCII only.
    :param value:
        The value of the parameter, provided as a unicode string.
    
    Iterate over fields.

    Supports list of (k, v) tuples and dicts, and lists of
    :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField`.

    
    Encode a dictionary of ``fields`` using the multipart/form-data MIME format.

    :param fields:
        Dictionary of fields or list of (key, :class:`~urllib3.fields.RequestField`).

        doesn't pass any additional parameters to the
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ConnectionPool` constructor.

        Additional parameters are taken from the :class:`.PoolManager`
        constructor.
        %s://%s:%i_new_pool
        Get a :class:`ConnectionPool` based on the host, port, and scheme.

    :param num_pools:
        Number of connection pools to cache before discarding the least
        recently used pool.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param \**connection_pool_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ConnectionPool` instances.

    Example::

    ProxyManager.connection_from_host
    Behaves just like :class:`PoolManager`, but sends all requests through
    the defined proxy, using the CONNECT method for HTTPS URLs.

    :param proxy_url:
        The URL of the proxy to be used.

    :param proxy_headers:
        A dictionary contaning headers that will be sent to the proxy. In case
        of HTTP they are being sent with each request, while in the
        HTTPS/CONNECT case they are sent only once. Could be used for proxy
        authentication.

    Example:
        >>> proxy = urllib3.ProxyManager('http://localhost:3128/')
        >>> r1 = proxy.request('GET', 'http://google.com/')
        >>> r2 = proxy.request('GET', 'http://httpbin.org/')

    C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\requests\packages\urllib3\poolmanager.pyProxyManager.urlopen
        Sets headers needed by proxies: specifically, the Accept and Host
        headers. Only sets headers not provided by the user.
        ProxyManager.__init__
        Same as :meth:`urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen`
        with custom cross-host redirect logic and only sends the request-uri
        portion of the ``url``.

        The given ``url`` parameter must be absolute, such that an appropriate
        :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.ConnectionPool` can be chosen for it.
        PoolManager.connection_from_urlrequests.packages.urllib3.poolmanagerPoolManager.__exit__PoolManager.connection_from_host
        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the ``fields`` encoded in
        the url. This is useful for request methods like GET, HEAD, DELETE, etc.
        multipart_boundaryrequest_encode_body
    Convenience mixin for classes who implement a :meth:`urlopen` method, such
    as :class:`~urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool` and
    :class:`~urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager`.

    Provides behavior for making common types of HTTP request methods and
    decides which type of request field encoding to use.

    Specifically,

    :meth:`.request_encode_url` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the URL (such as GET, HEAD, DELETE).

    :meth:`.request_encode_body` is for sending requests whose fields are
    encoded in the *body* of the request using multipart or www-form-urlencoded
    (such as for POST, PUT, PATCH).

    :meth:`.request` is for making any kind of request, it will look up the
    appropriate encoding format and use one of the above two methods to make
    the request.

    Initializer parameters:

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.
    requests.packages.urllib3.requestRequestMethods.__init__
        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the ``fields`` encoded in
        the body. This is useful for request methods like POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.

        When ``encode_multipart=True`` (default), then
        :meth:`urllib3.filepost.encode_multipart_formdata` is used to encode
        the payload with the appropriate content type. Otherwise
        :meth:`urllib.urlencode` is used with the
        'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' content type.

        Multipart encoding must be used when posting files, and it's reasonably
        safe to use it in other times too. However, it may break request
        signing, such as with OAuth.

        Supports an optional ``fields`` parameter of key/value strings AND
        key/filetuple. A filetuple is a (filename, data, MIME type) tuple where
        the MIME type is optional. For example::

            fields = {
                'foo': 'bar',
                'fakefile': ('foofile.txt', 'contents of foofile'),
                'realfile': ('barfile.txt', open('realfile').read()),
                'typedfile': ('bazfile.bin', open('bazfile').read(),
                              'image/jpeg'),
                'nonamefile': 'contents of nonamefile field',
            }

        When uploading a file, providing a filename (the first parameter of the
        tuple) is optional but recommended to best mimick behavior of browsers.

        Note that if ``headers`` are supplied, the 'Content-Type' header will
        be overwritten because it depends on the dynamic random boundary string
        which is used to compose the body of the request. The random boundary
        string can be explicitly set with the ``multipart_boundary`` parameter.
        request got values for both 'fields' and 'body', can only specify one._encode_url_methods
        Make a request using :meth:`urlopen` with the appropriate encoding of
        ``fields`` based on the ``method`` used.

        This is a convenience method that requires the least amount of manual
        effort. It can be used in most situations, while still having the
        option to drop down to more specific methods when necessary, such as
        :meth:`request_encode_url`, :meth:`request_encode_body`,
        or even the lowest level :meth:`urlopen`.

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. The generator will return up to
            much data per iteration, but may return less. This is particularly
            likely when using compressed data. However, the empty string will
            never be returned.

        Similar to :meth:`httplib.HTTPResponse.read`, but with two additional

        :param amt:
            How much of the content to read. If specified, caching is skipped
            because it doesn't make sense to cache partial content as the full
            response.

        :param decode_content:
            If True, will attempt to decode the body based on the
            'content-encoding' header.

        :param cache_content:
            If True, will save the returned data such that the same result is
            returned despite of the state of the underlying file object. This

    HTTP Response container.

    Backwards-compatible to httplib's HTTPResponse but the response ``body`` is
    loaded and decoded on-demand when the ``data`` property is accessed.  This
    class is also compatible with the Python standard library's :mod:`io`
    module, and can hence be treated as a readable object in the context of that
    framework.

    Extra parameters for behaviour not present in httplib.HTTPResponse:

    :param preload_content:
        If True, the response's body will be preloaded during construction.

    :param decode_content:
        If True, attempts to decode specific content-encoding's based on headers
        (like 'gzip' and 'deflate') will be skipped and raw data will be used
        instead.

    :param original_response:
        When this HTTPResponse wrapper is generated from an httplib.HTTPResponse
        object, it's convenient to include the original for debug purposes. It's
        otherwise unused.

    Convenience function.  Connect to *address* (a 2-tuple ``(host,
    port)``) and return the socket object.  Passing the optional
    *timeout* parameter will set the timeout on the socket instance
    before attempting to connect.  If no *timeout* is supplied, the
    global default timeout setting returned by :func:`getdefaulttimeout`
    is used.  If *source_address* is set it must be a tuple of (host, port)
    for the socket to bind as a source address before making the connection.
    An host of '' or port 0 tells the OS to use the default.

        backoff_factormethod_whiteliststatus_forcelist Backwards-compatibility for the old retries format. Retry configuration.

    Each retry attempt will create a new Retry object with updated values, so
    they can be safely reused.

    Retries can be defined as a default for a pool::

        retries = Retry(connect=5, read=2, redirect=5)
        http = PoolManager(retries=retries)
        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/')

    Or per-request (which overrides the default for the pool)::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=Retry(10))

    Retries can be disabled by passing ``False``::

        response = http.request('GET', 'http://example.com/', retries=False)

    Errors will be wrapped in :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` unless
    retries are disabled, in which case the causing exception will be raised.

    :param int total:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

        Set to ``None`` to remove this constraint and fall back on other
        counts. It's a good idea to set this to some sensibly-high value to
        account for unexpected edge cases and avoid infinite retry loops.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param int connect:
        How many connection-related errors to retry on.

        These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,
        which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int read:
        How many times to retry on read errors.

        These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the
        request may have side-effects.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

    :param int redirect:
        How many redirects to perform. Limit this to avoid infinite redirect
        loops.

        A redirect is a HTTP response with a status code 301, 302, 303, 307 or
        308.

        Set to ``0`` to fail on the first retry of this type.

        Set to ``False`` to disable and imply ``raise_on_redirect=False``.

    :param iterable method_whitelist:
        Set of uppercased HTTP method verbs that we should retry on.

        By default, we only retry on methods which are considered to be
        indempotent (multiple requests with the same parameters end with the
        same state). See :attr:`Retry.DEFAULT_METHOD_WHITELIST`.

    :param iterable status_forcelist:
        A set of HTTP status codes that we should force a retry on.

        By default, this is disabled with ``None``.

    :param float backoff_factor:
        A backoff factor to apply between attempts. urllib3 will sleep for::

            {backoff factor} * (2 ^ ({number of total retries} - 1))

        seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then :func:`.sleep` will sleep
        for [0.1s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. It will never be longer
        than :attr:`Retry.BACKOFF_MAX`.

        By default, backoff is disabled (set to 0).

    :param bool raise_on_redirect: Whether, if the number of redirects is
        exhausted, to raise a MaxRetryError, or to return a response with a
        response code in the 3xx range.

    All arguments have the same meaning as ``ssl_wrap_socket``.

    By default, this function does a lot of the same work that
    ``ssl.create_default_context`` does on Python 3.4+. It:

    - Disables SSLv2, SSLv3, and compression
    - Sets a restricted set of server ciphers

    If you wish to enable SSLv3, you can do::

        from urllib3.util import ssl_
        context = ssl_.create_urllib3_context()
        context.options &= ~ssl_.OP_NO_SSLv3

    You can do the same to enable compression (substituting ``COMPRESSION``
    for ``SSLv3`` in the last line above).

    :param ssl_version:
        The desired protocol version to use. This will default to
        PROTOCOL_SSLv23 which will negotiate the highest protocol that both
        the server and your installation of OpenSSL support.
    :param cert_reqs:
        Whether to require the certificate verification. This defaults to
        ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``.
    :param options:
        Specific OpenSSL options. These default to ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2``,
        ``ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3``, ``ssl.OP_NO_COMPRESSION``.

    Timeouts can be disabled by setting all the parameters to ``None``::

        The maximum amount of time to wait between consecutive
        read operations for a response from the server. Omitting
        the parameter will default the read timeout to the system
        default, probably `the global default timeout in socket.py
        <http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/603b4d593758/Lib/socket.py#l535>`_.
        None will set an infinite timeout.

    :type read: integer, float, or None

    .. note::

        Many factors can affect the total amount of time for urllib3 to return
        an HTTP response.

        For example, Python's DNS resolver does not obey the timeout specified
        on the socket. Other factors that can affect total request time include
        high CPU load, high swap, the program running at a low priority level,
        or other behaviors.

        In addition, the read and total timeouts only measure the time between
        read operations on the socket connecting the client and the server,
        not the total amount of time for the request to return a complete
        response. For most requests, the timeout is raised because the server
        has not sent the first byte in the specified time. This is not always
        the case; if a server streams one byte every fifteen seconds, a timeout
        of 20 seconds will not trigger, even though the request will take
        several minutes to complete.

        If your goal is to cut off any request after a set amount of wall clock
        time, consider having a second "watcher" thread to cut off a slow
        request.

    Given a url, return a parsed :class:`.Url` namedtuple. Best-effort is

    Partly backwards-compatible with :mod:`urlparse`.

    Example::

    Given a string and an iterable of delimiters, split on the first found

        >>> split_first('foo/bar?baz', '123')

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a Session object to manage and persist settings across
requests (cookies, auth, proxies).

Session.optionsReturns a :class:`Session` for context-management.A Requests session.

    Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.

    Basic Usage::

      >>> import requests
      >>> s = requests.Session()
      >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
      <Response [200]>

    Or as a context manager::

      >>> with requests.Session() as s:
      >>>     s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
      <Response [200]>
    
        When being redirected we may want to strip authentication from the
        request to avoid leaking credentials. This method intelligently removes
        and reapplies authentication where possible to avoid credential loss.

    A case-insensitive ``dict``-like object.

    Implements all methods and operations of
    ``collections.MutableMapping`` as well as dict's ``copy``. Also
    provides ``lower_items``.

    All keys are expected to be strings. The structure remembers the
    case of the last key to be set, and ``iter(instance)``,
    ``keys()``, ``items()``, ``iterkeys()``, and ``iteritems()``
    will contain case-sensitive keys. However, querying and contains
    testing is case insensitive::

        cid = CaseInsensitiveDict()
        cid['Accept'] = 'application/json'
        cid['aCCEPT'] == 'application/json'  # True
        list(cid) == ['Accept']  # True

    For example, ``headers['content-encoding']`` will return the
    value of a ``'Content-Encoding'`` response header, regardless
    of how the header name was originally stored.

    If the constructor, ``.update``, or equality comparison
    operations are given keys that have equal ``.lower()``s, the

This module implements certain functionality from PKCS#1 version 1.5. For a
very clear example, read http://www.di-mgt.com.au/rsa_alg.html#pkcs1schemes

At least 8 bytes of random padding is used when encrypting a message. This makes
these methods much more secure than the ones in the ``rsa`` module.

WARNING: this module leaks information when decryption fails. The exceptions
that are raised contain the Python traceback information, which can be used to
deduce where in the process the failure occurred. DO NOT PASS SUCH INFORMATION

        byte string is expected to be the fill size and will be padded
        with prefix zero bytes to satisfy that length.
    :param chunk_size:
        If optional chunk size is given and greater than zero, pad the front of
        the byte string with binary zeros so that the length is a multiple of
        ``chunk_size``.
    :param overflow:
        ``False`` (default). If this is ``True``, no ``OverflowError``
        will be raised when the fill_size is shorter than the length
        of the generated byte sequence. Instead the byte sequence will
        be returned as is.
    :returns:
        Raw bytes (base-256 representation).
    :raises:
        ``OverflowError`` when fill_size is given and the number takes up more
        bytes than fit into the block. This requires the ``overflow``
        argument to this function to be set to ``False`` otherwise, no
        error will be raised.
    _int2bytesData transformation functions.

From bytes to a number, number to bytes, etc.
rsa.transformConverts a list of bytes or an 8-bit string to an integer.

    When using unicode strings, encode it to some encoding like UTF8 first.

    >>> (((128 * 256) + 64) * 256) + 15
    8405007
    >>> bytes2int('\x80@\x0f')
    8405007

    Number must be an unsigned integer: %dNegative numbers cannot be used: %iConverts a number to a string of bytes.

    Usage::

        >>> _int2bytes(123456789)
        '\x07[\xcd\x15'
        >>> bytes2int(_int2bytes(123456789))

        >>> bytes2int(_int2bytes(123456789, 128))
        123456789

        >>> _int2bytes(123456789, 3)

The VARBLOCK file format is as follows, where || denotes byte concatenation:

    FILE := VERSION || BLOCK || BLOCK ...

    BLOCK := LENGTH || DATA

    LENGTH := varint-encoded length of the subsequent data. Varint comes from
    Google Protobuf, and encodes an integer into a variable number of bytes.
    Each byte uses the 7 lowest bits to encode the value. The highest bit set
    to 1 indicates the next byte is also part of the varint. The last byte will
    have this bit set to 0.

This file format is called the VARBLOCK format, in line with the varint format
used to denote the block sizes.

VARBLOCK version %i not supportedBlock size is %i, but could read only %i bytesyield_varblocksWrites a varint to a file.

    @param outfile: the file-like object to write to. It should have a write()
        method.
    @returns the number of written bytes.
    write_varintEOF while reading varint, value is %i so farReads a varint from the file.

    When the first byte to be read indicates EOF, (0, 0) is returned. When an
    EOF occurs when at least one byte has been read, an EOFError exception is
    raised.

    @param infile: the file-like object to read from. It should have a read()
        method.
    @returns (varint, length), the read varint and the number of read bytes.

    If ``skipkeys`` is false then ``dict`` keys that are not basic types
    (``str``, ``unicode``, ``int``, ``long``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``)
    will be skipped instead of raising a ``TypeError``.

    If ``ensure_ascii`` is false, then the return value will be a
    ``unicode`` instance subject to normal Python ``str`` to ``unicode``
    coercion rules instead of being escaped to an ASCII ``str``.

    If ``check_circular`` is false, then the circular reference check
    for container types will be skipped and a circular reference will
    result in an ``OverflowError`` (or worse).

    If ``allow_nan`` is false, then it will be a ``ValueError`` to
    serialize out of range ``float`` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) in
    strict compliance of the JSON specification, instead of using the
    JavaScript equivalents (``NaN``, ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``).

    If ``indent`` is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
    will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
    for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
    representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
    versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
    and is converted to a string with that many spaces.

    If specified, ``separators`` should be an
    ``(item_separator, key_separator)`` tuple.  The default is ``(', ', ': ')``
    if *indent* is ``None`` and ``(',', ': ')`` otherwise.  To get the most
    compact JSON representation, you should specify ``(',', ':')`` to eliminate
    whitespace.

    ``encoding`` is the character encoding for str instances, default is UTF-8.

    ``default(obj)`` is a function that should return a serializable version
    of obj or raise TypeError. The default simply raises TypeError.

    If *use_decimal* is true (default: ``True``) then decimal.Decimal
    will be natively serialized to JSON with full precision.

    If *namedtuple_as_object* is true (default: ``True``),
    :class:`tuple` subclasses with ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded
    as JSON objects.

    If *tuple_as_array* is true (default: ``True``),
    :class:`tuple` (and subclasses) will be encoded as JSON arrays.

    If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
    any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
    will be encoded as a JSON array.

    If *bigint_as_string* is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
    or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
    rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.

    If *int_as_string_bitcount* is a positive number (n), then int of size
    greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
    encoded as strings.

    If specified, *item_sort_key* is a callable used to sort the items in
    each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
    in alphabetical order by key. This option takes precendence over
    *sort_keys*.

    If *sort_keys* is true (default: ``False``), the output of dictionaries
    will be sorted by item.

    If *for_json* is true (default: ``False``), objects with a ``for_json()``
    method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
    instead of the object.

    If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
    :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized as
    ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true, this will
    override *allow_nan*.

    To use a custom ``JSONEncoder`` subclass (e.g. one that overrides the
    ``.default()`` method to serialize additional types), specify it with
    the ``cls`` kwarg. NOTE: You should use *default* instead of subclassing
    whenever possible.

    Helper function to pass to item_sort_key to sort simple
    elements to the top, then container elements.
    use_decimal=True implies parse_float=DecimalDeserialize ``fp`` (a ``.read()``-supporting file-like object containing
    a JSON document) to a Python object.

    *encoding* determines the encoding used to interpret any
    :class:`str` objects decoded by this instance (``'utf-8'`` by
    default).  It has no effect when decoding :class:`unicode` objects.

    Note that currently only encodings that are a superset of ASCII work,
    strings of other encodings should be passed in as :class:`unicode`.

    *object_hook*, if specified, will be called with the result of every
    JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in place of the
    given :class:`dict`.  This can be used to provide custom
    deserializations (e.g. to support JSON-RPC class hinting).

    *object_pairs_hook* is an optional function that will be called with
    the result of any object literal decode with an ordered list of pairs.
    The return value of *object_pairs_hook* will be used instead of the
    :class:`dict`.  This feature can be used to implement custom decoders
    that rely on the order that the key and value pairs are decoded (for
    example, :func:`collections.OrderedDict` will remember the order of
    insertion). If *object_hook* is also defined, the *object_pairs_hook*
    takes priority.

    *parse_float*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
    JSON float to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
    ``float(num_str)``. This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON floats (e.g. :class:`decimal.Decimal`).

    *parse_int*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
    JSON int to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
    ``int(num_str)``.  This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON integers (e.g. :class:`float`).

    *parse_constant*, if specified, will be called with one of the
    following strings: ``'-Infinity'``, ``'Infinity'``, ``'NaN'``.  This
    can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are
    encountered.

    If *use_decimal* is true (default: ``False``) then it implies
    parse_float=decimal.Decimal for parity with ``dump``.

    To use a custom ``JSONDecoder`` subclass, specify it with the ``cls``
    kwarg. NOTE: You should use *object_hook* or *object_pairs_hook* instead
    of subclassing whenever possible.

    Serialize ``obj`` as a JSON formatted stream to ``fp`` (a
    ``.write()``-supporting file-like object).

    If *skipkeys* is true then ``dict`` keys that are not basic types
    (``str``, ``unicode``, ``int``, ``long``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``)
    will be skipped instead of raising a ``TypeError``.

    If *ensure_ascii* is false, then the some chunks written to ``fp``
    may be ``unicode`` instances, subject to normal Python ``str`` to
    ``unicode`` coercion rules. Unless ``fp.write()`` explicitly
    understands ``unicode`` (as in ``codecs.getwriter()``) this is likely
    to cause an error.

    If *check_circular* is false, then the circular reference check
    for container types will be skipped and a circular reference will
    result in an ``OverflowError`` (or worse).

    If *allow_nan* is false, then it will be a ``ValueError`` to
    serialize out of range ``float`` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``)
    in strict compliance of the original JSON specification, instead of using
    the JavaScript equivalents (``NaN``, ``Infinity``, ``-Infinity``). See
    *ignore_nan* for ECMA-262 compliant behavior.

    If *indent* is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
    will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
    for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
    representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
    versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
    and is converted to a string with that many spaces.

    If specified, *separators* should be an
    ``(item_separator, key_separator)`` tuple.  The default is ``(', ', ': ')``

    compact JSON representation, you should specify ``(',', ':')`` to eliminate

    *encoding* is the character encoding for str instances, default is UTF-8.

    *default(obj)* is a function that should return a serializable version
    of obj or raise ``TypeError``. The default simply raises ``TypeError``.

    If *use_decimal* is true (default: ``True``) then decimal.Decimal
    will be natively serialized to JSON with full precision.

    If *namedtuple_as_object* is true (default: ``True``),
    :class:`tuple` subclasses with ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded
    as JSON objects.

    If *tuple_as_array* is true (default: ``True``),
    :class:`tuple` (and subclasses) will be encoded as JSON arrays.

    If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
    any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
    will be encoded as a JSON array.

    If *bigint_as_string* is true (default: ``False``), ints 2**53 and higher
    or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
    rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise. Note that this is still a
    lossy operation that will not round-trip correctly and should be used
    sparingly.

    If *int_as_string_bitcount* is a positive number (n), then int of size
    greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
    encoded as strings.

    If specified, *item_sort_key* is a callable used to sort the items in
    each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
    in alphabetical order by key. This option takes precedence over
    *sort_keys*.

    If *sort_keys* is true (default: ``False``), the output of dictionaries
    will be sorted by item.

    If *for_json* is true (default: ``False``), objects with a ``for_json()``
    method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
    instead of the object.

    If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
    :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized as
    ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true, this will
    override *allow_nan*.

    To use a custom ``JSONEncoder`` subclass (e.g. one that overrides the

    C:\Python34\Lib\site-packages\simplejson\__init__.pyJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) <http://json.org> is a subset of
JavaScript syntax (ECMA-262 3rd edition) used as a lightweight data
interchange format.

:mod:`simplejson` exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library
:mod:`marshal` and :mod:`pickle` modules. It is the externally maintained
version of the :mod:`json` library contained in Python 2.6, but maintains
compatibility back to Python 2.5 and (currently) has significant performance
advantages, even without using the optional C extension for speedups.

Encoding basic Python object hierarchies::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> json.dumps(['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}])
    '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]'
    >>> print(json.dumps("\"foo\bar"))
    "\"foo\bar"
    >>> print(json.dumps(u'\u1234'))
    "\u1234"
    >>> print(json.dumps('\\'))
    "\\"
    >>> print(json.dumps({"c": 0, "b": 0, "a": 0}, sort_keys=True))
    {"a": 0, "b": 0, "c": 0}
    >>> from simplejson.compat import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO()
    >>> json.dump(['streaming API'], io)
    >>> io.getvalue()
    '["streaming API"]'

Compact encoding::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> obj = [1,2,3,{'4': 5, '6': 7}]
    >>> json.dumps(obj, separators=(',',':'), sort_keys=True)
    '[1,2,3,{"4":5,"6":7}]'

Pretty printing::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> print(json.dumps({'4': 5, '6': 7}, sort_keys=True, indent='    '))
    {
        "4": 5,
        "6": 7
    }

Decoding JSON::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> obj = [u'foo', {u'bar': [u'baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
    >>> json.loads('["foo", {"bar":["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]') == obj
    True
    >>> json.loads('"\\"foo\\bar"') == u'"foo\x08ar'
    True
    >>> from simplejson.compat import StringIO
    >>> io = StringIO('["streaming API"]')
    >>> json.load(io)[0] == 'streaming API'
    True

Specializing JSON object decoding::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> def as_complex(dct):
    ...     if '__complex__' in dct:
    ...         return complex(dct['real'], dct['imag'])
    ...     return dct
    ...
    >>> json.loads('{"__complex__": true, "real": 1, "imag": 2}',
    ...     object_hook=as_complex)
    (1+2j)
    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> json.loads('1.1', parse_float=Decimal) == Decimal('1.1')
    True

Specializing JSON object encoding::

    >>> import simplejson as json
    >>> def encode_complex(obj):
    ...     if isinstance(obj, complex):
    ...         return [obj.real, obj.imag]
    ...     raise TypeError(repr(o) + " is not JSON serializable")
    ...
    >>> json.dumps(2 + 1j, default=encode_complex)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).encode(2 + 1j)
    '[2.0, 1.0]'
    >>> ''.join(json.JSONEncoder(default=encode_complex).iterencode(2 + 1j))
    '[2.0, 1.0]'


Using simplejson.tool from the shell to validate and pretty-print::

    $ echo '{"json":"obj"}' | python -m simplejson.tool

        "json": "obj"
    }
    $ echo '{ 1.2:3.4}' | python -m simplejson.tool

        example, :func:`collections.OrderedDict` will remember the order of
        insertion). If *object_hook* is also defined, the *object_pairs_hook*
        takes priority.

        *parse_float*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
        JSON float to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
        ``float(num_str)``. This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON floats (e.g. :class:`decimal.Decimal`).

        *parse_int*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
        JSON int to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
        ``int(num_str)``.  This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON integers (e.g. :class:`float`).

        *parse_constant*, if specified, will be called with one of the
        following strings: ``'-Infinity'``, ``'Infinity'``, ``'NaN'``.  This
        can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are
        encountered.

        *strict* controls the parser's behavior when it encounters an
        invalid control character in a string. The default setting of
        ``True`` means that unescaped control characters are parse errors, if
        ``False`` then control characters will be allowed in strings.

        beginning with a JSON document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python
        representation and the index in ``s`` where the document ended.
        Optionally, ``idx`` can be used to specify an offset in ``s`` where
        the JSON document begins.

        This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may
        have extraneous data at the end.

        JSONEncoder.__init__Encode the given object and yield each string
        representation as available.

        For example::

            for chunk in JSONEncoder().iterencode(bigobject):
                mysocket.write(chunk)

        JSONEncoder.iterencode.<locals>._encoderImplement this method in a subclass such that it returns
        a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
        (to raise a ``TypeError``).

        For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
        implement default like this::

            def default(self, o):
                try:
                    iterable = iter(o)

                    pass
                else:
                    return list(iterable)

    +-------------------+---------------+
    | None              | null          |
    +-------------------+---------------+

    To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
    ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
    object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
    implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).

    ([\\"]|[^\ -~])Return a JSON representation of a Python string

    Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.

        If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
        encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
        skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.

        If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
        objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
        ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.

        If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
        objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
        prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
        Otherwise, no such check takes place.

        If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
        encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
        but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
        Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.

        If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
        sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
        that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.

        If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
        will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
        for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
        representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
        versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
        and is converted to a string with that many spaces.

        If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
        tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
        (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
        you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.

        If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
        that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
        version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.

        If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
        transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
        The default is UTF-8.

        If use_decimal is true (not the default), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
        be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
        with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.

        If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
        ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.

        If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
        be encoded as JSON arrays.

        If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
        any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
        will be encoded as a JSON array.

        If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
        or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
        rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.

        If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
        greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
        encoded as strings.

        If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
        each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
        in alphabetical order by key.

        If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
        method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
        instead of the object.

        If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
        :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
        as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
        this will override *allow_nan*.
